# What is Crowing Project 1.0?
This project is the result of another research project in which I am currently working to obtain a master's degree. My goal is to determine what kind of technology in machine translation offers better translation output. These technologies are data-driven, meaning that they depend on great quantities of bitexts. Unfortunately, Costa Rica does not count with a strong data base of bitexts like the EU and the Canadian governments. This means that there is little representation of bitexts in the combination of es_CR > en. Thus, in order to tackle this issue, to foster research and to increase public resources available to translators, it is necessary to create a bank of data (open data). 

# Who can join this project?
I am currently looking for translators who can volunteer to translate in the following combinations en > es_CR and es_CR > en. 
See, translators are key elements in the chain of this process. As I said before, machine translation cannot be possible without translators, who are the creators of bitexts and who have the proper academic background to say what is a translation and what is not.

# How to contribute?
You can join my project! Contact me at www.gcocozza.com
Bear in mind that I am also a student. Thus, I cannot pay you. However, I can guarantee you that this is a win-win situation. By translating for this project, you will be helping me elaborate the necessary instruments for my research project. Also, by volunteering your time and effort, you will gain experience in the so called "localization industry." You can add to your resume not only this valuable experience, but also the fact that you have worked in a localization environment such as the platform Crowdin.
